# Travelocity

Travelling is a hobby that relaxes your soul inside out. Many people love to travel and have a quench to explore the world. Often these desires are discouraged due to high priced air tickets. Each one of us have come across a lot of sites that offer competitive pricing but there are hardly any that actually guide you through the entire booking process. 

Researching through different sites is the first most important thing to understand the pricing dynamics. Kyak. Skyscanner, makemytrip, goibibo and many more give an option of comparing numerous options under one link; same combination of origin and destination airport, arrival and departure time. 

There are two channels through which a customer can buy an air ticket â€“ Online or At Locket. Depending on the channel used, the process flow differs marginally.

**At Locket:**
Passenger physically goes to a ticket counter (Locket) and asks for a particular departure location. Once the departure is found, the passenger is asked for a destination location. After the destination is locked in, passenger data is asked for. Name, age, sex, address, ID proof details, if the destination is an international location then the passport details are asked as well. On confirmation, the system asks about the payment information and redirects to the relevant payment gateway. A hard-copy of the ticket and booking reference is handed over to the passenger once the payment is successful.
