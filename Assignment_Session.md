# Travelocity

Travelling is a hobby that relaxes your soul inside out. Many people love to travel and have a quench to explore the world. Often these desires are discouraged due to high priced air tickets. Each one of us have come across a lot of sites that offer competitive pricing but there are hardly any that actually guide you through the entire booking process. 

Researching through different sites is the first most important thing to understand the pricing dynamics. Kyak. Skyscanner, makemytrip, goibibo and many more give an option of comparing numerous options under one link; same combination of origin and destination airport, arrival and departure time. 

There are two channels through which a customer can buy an air ticket â€“ Online or At Locket. Depending on the channel used, the process flow differs marginally.
